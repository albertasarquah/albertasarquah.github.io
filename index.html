<h2>Brief Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ghana is a country located in West Africa, bordered by Ivory Coast to the west, Burkina Faso to the north, Togo to the east, and the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean to the south.
        Its capital is Accra, and English is the official language. With a population of around 33 million people, Ghana is one of the most well-known and culturally diverse nations in the region.
        Historically, Ghana holds a special place in Africa as the first country to gain independence from colonial rule in 1957.
        Kwame Nkrumah, its first president, led the country to freedom from British colonialism, which marked a significant milestone in African history.
        Over time, Ghana has experienced both democratic governance and political instability, including periods of military coups, but it has grown into one of the more politically stable nations in Africa.
        The economy of Ghana is one of the fastest-growing in Africa. It is heavily reliant on gold mining, cocoa production (the country is one of the world's largest cocoa producers), and oil.
        Agriculture remains a key component, with cocoa being a major export, as well as other products like timber, and palm oil.
        Culturally, Ghana is a melting pot of ethnic groups, with the Akan, Mole-Dagbani, Ewe, and Ga-Dangme being the most prominent.
        These groups have their own distinct languages, traditions, and ceremonies, and the country's music, particularly highlife and gospel, plays an important role in daily life. Festivals, traditional dances, and vibrant art are significant parts of Ghanaian identity.
        Tourism also plays a role in Ghana’s economy, with visitors drawn to its historical landmarks, such as the Cape Coast Castle, a remnant of the transatlantic slave trade.
        The country's beautiful beaches along the coast and national parks like Kakum National Park also attract tourists seeking adventure and nature.</li>

            Ghana is a culturally diverse nation with over 100 ethnic groups, each contributing unique traditions, languages, and customs.
            The major ethnic groups include the Akan (such as Ashanti and Fante), Mole-Dagbani, Ewe, Ga-Dangme, and Guan, among others.
            Ghana is home to over 80 languages, with English as the official language.
            Traditional festivals like Homowo (Ga), Aboakyer (Effutu), and Hogbetsotso (Ewe) showcase the country’s rich heritage.
            Despite differences, Ghanaians share a strong sense of unity, hospitality, and respect for traditions, making the country a vibrant and harmonious cultural hub.

<h4>Languages in Ghana</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Ghana is a multilingual country with over 80 languages spoken across different regions. The official language is English, inherited from colonial rule, and it is used in government, education, and business. However, several indigenous languages are widely spoken, with Twi (Akan), Ewe, Ga, Dagbani, Nzema, Gonja, and Kasem being some of the most prominent.
            Twi, a dialect of the Akan language, is one of the most widely spoken local languages, especially in the southern and central parts of Ghana. In the north, Dagbani is a major language among the Mole-Dagbani people. The Ewe language is common in the Volta Region, while Ga is spoken by the Ga people in Greater Accra.
            Ghana promotes linguistic diversity, and many citizens are multilingual, often speaking their local dialect alongside English. Indigenous languages are also taught in schools, helping to preserve Ghana's rich linguistic heritage.
